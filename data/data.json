They wanted not only to excite kids about science but to empower them to do science, and thought a believable, relatable character having exciting adventures was the way to do it. The comic book series features Ada, a girl who isn't afraid to ask questions about the world around her. Ada dreams of doing exciting science and making discoveries like her science heroes, while riding the school bus and playing with her friends. Finally Ada achieves her dream of becoming a professional scientist and taking part in a big discovery, through the course of the 3 comic books.</p><p>Educational resources are also available</p>",

Due to lack of gravity and shifting fluids, things can taste very different in space. In this activity students will carry out a taste test to explore how our senses affect the flavour of our food, and what this might reveal about eating in space.",
