They wanted not only to excite kids about science but to empower them to do science, and thought a believable, relatable character having exciting adventures was the way to do it. The comic book series features Ada, a girl who isn't afraid to ask questions about the world around her. Ada dreams of doing exciting science and making discoveries like her science heroes, while riding the school bus and playing with her friends. Finally Ada achieves her dream of becoming a professional scientist and taking part in a big discovery, through the course of the 3 comic books.</p><p>Educational resources are also available</p>","Edward Gomez, Laura Sorvala",,"Science, Equality & Diversity, Literacy",7-9;9-11;11-14;14-18,,,,,

Astronaut Training: Taste,Astronomy,Resource,Craft; Independent Research,,https://lco.global/education/activities/astronaut-training-taste/,taste-test.jpg,"There are no refrigerators or ovens on the International Space Station, but that isn't the only reason that eating can be a strange experience for astronauts. Due to lack of gravity and shifting fluids, things can taste very different in space. In this activity students will carry out a taste test to explore how our senses affect the flavour of our food, and what this might reveal about eating in space.",Las Cumbres Observatory,,Space Exploration; Biology (Nutrition),7-9; 9-11,,,,,

One method scientists use to answer this important question is counting the number of craters on their surface. This information, combined with the time it takes for craters to form on each body, gives us a strong estimate how old the object is. In this activity students will put this method into practise to calculate the age of five bodies within our Solar System.",Las Cumbres Observatory,,Astronomy; Ages; Impacts,11-14; 14-16,,,Print; Any device,,
